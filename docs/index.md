# 🏠 Welcome to the PE Documentation Base

**PE** (or **P**oly **E**lectrolyte, if you want to define the acronym) is a powerful, coarse-grained simulation software first designed for modelling of complex polyelectrolytic systems.

### **💡 What is Coarse-Grained Simulation?**

Coarse-grained simulation simplifies complex systems by grouping multiple atoms or elements into single, larger "particles." This approach significantly reduces computational complexity, allowing us to:

* Run simulations much faster than all-atom models.
* Model systems at larger scales.
* Focus on macroscopic behaviors and properties.
